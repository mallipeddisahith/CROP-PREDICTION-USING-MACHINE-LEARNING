# CROP-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project aims to predict the yield of various crops cultivated across India using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Farmers in many regions often grow the same crops every season without evaluating whether environmental and soil conditions are suitable for better alternativesThis project seeks to address that problem by offering data-driven insights to help farmers choose the most suitable crops, improving productivity, profitability, and sustainability.

Developed using Python, the system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical agricultural data that includes key parameters such as state, district, season, soil type, cultivation area, fertilizer usage, rainfall, and temperature. By studying these factors, the model predicts the yield of different crops and recommends the most optimal ones for specific regions. This not only enhances crop diversity but also helps farmers reduce losses caused by unfavorable conditions or poor crop choices.

To achieve accurate predictions, the project employs deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs). These models are trained on past datasets to identify patterns and relationships among environmental factors and crop yields. LSTM and RNN models are particularly effective in capturing seasonal and temporal variations, which play a crucial role in agricultural outcomes. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to enhance model performance and reliability.

The project also includes uncertainty estimation, allowing the system to provide a range of possible yield outcomes rather than a single value. This enables more informed decision-making by farmers and policymakers. A user-friendly interface will be developed, enabling users to input relevant data such as location, soil characteristics, and season to receive accurate predictions and crop recommendations.

In summary, this project integrates artificial intelligence with agriculture to support sustainable farming, improve decision-making, and increase overall productivity across India.
